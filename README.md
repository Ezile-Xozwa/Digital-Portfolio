**Task**: I needed to understand myself, distinguish between a job and a career, explore suitable career paths, define a career goal for myself using the SMART framework.

**Action**: I worked through the learning material and completed the quizzes, which helped me better understand the content. I also reflected on my short-term aspirations and thought about what direction I should take next, balancing my interest in both data and design.

**Results**: I identified a short-term goal which is to secure an internship for my Work Integrated Learning in the IT field â€” ideally a data-related or UI/UX internship, which will help me gain relevant industry experience. To increase my chances, I plan to upskill by completing an online certificate in data analytic tools such as Power BI, Excel and Figma. I am also working on advancing my front-end development skills.
