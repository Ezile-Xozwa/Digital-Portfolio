### Reflection
Situation: I participated in a Career Development section of the Work Readiness Programme to gain better clarity on my career path in IT.
Task: The task was to get to know myself, understand the difference between a job and a career, look at career options, define what a suitable career goal for myself using the SMART technique and ultimately create a career plan for myselfâ€¦
Action: I reflected on what my aspiartions were, completed the quizzes which gave me a better understanding of what to focus on the through this journey and I drafted a goal-oriented development.
Results: I identified a short-term goal which is to get hired in a IT related job for my WIL but in order for that I plan to upskill because for higher chances to get hired.
